This is a hands-on Networking and Security project where I am building a corporate network from scratch using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Instead of just reading about CCNA concepts, I am literally laying down the cables, configuring the switches, and setting up strict security VLANs to segment network traffic.

Project Goals:
Network Segmentation: Creating secure, VLANs 10 & 20 so sensitive traffic stays isolated.

Switch Configuration: Programming access ports to be strict for specific VLANs.

Trunking (802.1Q): Building a Trunk Link so data can travel across the network without losing its security tags.

Security Verification: Proving that devices in different VLANs cannot snoop on each other without a router.

Tools Used:
Cisco Packet Tracer
